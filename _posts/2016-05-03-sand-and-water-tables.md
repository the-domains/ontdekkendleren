description: 'I have been reading the book by Alison Gopnik called The Philosophical Baby. On page 91, she states that children have an innate drive to experiment. That innate drive, in turn, allows them to learn things that are not innate. According to her, they have built-in techniques that help them discover what is not built in.'
